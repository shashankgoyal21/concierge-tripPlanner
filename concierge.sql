But one of the reasons why the beach state is so popular not just among foreign travelers but also Indian tourists is the freedom its local transport offers. Every hotel, small and large, has a tie-up with a scooter/bike/car rental, a service that isn’t very common in other states. All you need is a driver’s license and Goa is yours! Two-wheelers are particularly popular among locals too. Motorcycle taxis, which transport a single pillion rider, are the cheapest mode of local transport. This is how to reach Goa:</p>', '<section class="visit-list mt20"> \n <div class="htr-list"> \n  <aside class="htr-list-l"> \n   <i class="air fa fa-plane"></i> \n   <h2>By Air</h2> \n   <div class="clear"></div> \n   <p> Goa International Airport at Dabolim near Vasco da Gama is the state’s only airport. It caters to domestic and international air services with at least two dozen arrivals from India and middle-eastern countries such as Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Muscat, Doha, Dubai and Kuwait. Jet Airways, GoAir, Indigo, Air India, Qatar Airways and Air Arabia are among the major airlines that have scheduled flights to Goa. Several tourists from the UK and Russia avail of charter air services to Goa. In January 2016, the ministry of civil aviation relaxed the rules for charter airlines. Earlier chartered aircraft had to return empty after dropping off their passengers. With the change in the policy, these aircraft need not fly out with the same set of passengers thus cutting operating costs for airlines and reducing the tour package costs for travelers.</p> \n  </aside> \n  <div class="clear"></div> \n </div> \n <div class="htr-list"> \n  <aside class="htr-list-l"> \n   <i class="train fa fa-train"></i> \n   <h2>By Train</h2> \n   <div class="clear"></div> \n   <p> The South Western Railway and the Konkan Railway lines service the state of Goa. The former is a colonial era line that connects the port town of Vasco with Belgaum, Hubli etc. The more recent (and a pleasant) addition is the Konkan Railway line that was constructed in the ‘90s and connects Margao to cities along India’s western coast. Before the Konkan Railway line became operational, roadways were the most preferred mode of transport for people traveling from cities along the west coast, such as Mumbai. Panaji, the state capital, does not have a railway station.
